# nixfiles

These are my nix files. The goal is to get as much of my computer setup expressed declaratively. Nix provides declarative isolated build environments, which should speed up my productivity.

It also means I get to tinker around more, since everything is expressed as configuration. If something doesn't work, then I just turn it off. It builds over time.

To use

`sudo nixos-rebuild switch`
